# My_hunter
In this project, your task is to create a small video game inspired by the rules of Duck Hunt but with a Batman twist. You will step into the shoes of the iconic superhero, defending Gotham against an invasion of flying creatures using your Batarangs to eliminate them.

The basic rules for 'My_Hunter' are as follows:
• The player assumes the role of Batman, the guardian of Gotham, tasked with destroying the flying creatures.
• The flying creatures must appear on the screen and move from side to side.
• The player can eliminate them by clicking on them with their Batarangs.

Managing user inputs and displaying animated sprites are essential skills for developing basic games
